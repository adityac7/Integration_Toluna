## Edge Cases and Solutions

### 1. User Profile Edge Cases

#### Incomplete User Profiles
**Issue**: Users with incomplete profiles cannot be matched to surveys but may still expect to see available surveys.

**Solution**:
- Implement a profile completion score system
- Show a personalized message explaining why surveys are not available
- Provide direct links to complete specific missing profile fields
- Track and analyze commonly incomplete fields to improve UX

#### Conflicting Demographic Data
**Issue**: User may provide conflicting demographic information that doesn't align with Toluna's validation rules.

**Solution**:
- Implement validation rules that match Toluna's requirements
- Create a data consistency check before sending to Toluna
- Provide clear error messages when conflicts are detected
- Log and review common conflicts to improve form design

#### Profile Changes Impact
**Issue**: Users updating their profile information may suddenly qualify or disqualify for different surveys.

**Solution**:
- Implement a "profile change impact" notification
- Re-run matching algorithm after profile updates
- Maintain history of profile changes for audit purposes
- Consider a cooling-off period for major demographic changes

### 2. API and Integration Edge Cases

#### API Downtime
**Issue**: Toluna API may experience temporary downtime or degraded performance.

**Solution**:
- Implement a robust caching strategy for quota data
- Create a service status indicator for users and admins
- Design fallback UI states for when API is unavailable
- Establish automated monitoring and alerting system

#### Rate Limiting
**Issue**: Hitting API rate limits during peak usage periods.

**Solution**:
- Implement exponential backoff retry strategy
- Batch API requests where possible
- Optimize caching to reduce API call frequency
- Monitor API usage patterns and adjust accordingly

#### API Version Changes
**Issue**: Toluna may update their API, requiring changes to integration.

**Solution**:
- Monitor Toluna's API announcements
- Design modular code with clear separation of concerns
- Maintain API version in configuration
- Create an API adapter layer to handle version differences

#### Data Format Changes
**Issue**: Changes in data formats or field requirements from Toluna.

**Solution**:
- Implement flexible data mapping layer
- Validate all incoming/outgoing data against schemas
- Log detailed information about unexpected data formats
- Create automated tests for data transformation

### 3. User Experience Edge Cases

#### Survey Availability Fluctuations
**Issue**: Survey availability may change rapidly, leading to user confusion.

**Solution**:
- Implement real-time updates for survey availability
- Clearly communicate when surveys are no longer available
- Provide estimated times for new survey availability
- Offer alternative activities when surveys are limited

#### Survey Termination Handling
**Issue**: Users may be terminated from surveys for various reasons (quota full, quality checks, etc.).

**Solution**:
- Create distinct messaging for different termination reasons
- Offer immediate alternatives after termination
- Track termination patterns to identify potential issues
- Implement a "soft landing" experience after termination

#### Device Compatibility Issues
**Issue**: Surveys may have specific device requirements that change mid-session.

**Solution**:
- Clearly indicate device requirements before survey start
- Detect device capabilities automatically
- Filter surveys based on current device
- Provide option to save surveys for later on compatible devices

#### Long Survey Completion Times
**Issue**: Surveys may take longer than estimated, leading to abandonment.

**Solution**:
- Track actual vs. estimated completion times
- Adjust displayed estimates based on real data
- Allow users to pause and resume surveys when possible
- Provide progress indicators during survey completion

### 4. Business Logic Edge Cases

#### Reward Discrepancies
**Issue**: Differences between expected and actual rewards for completed surveys.

**Solution**:
- Maintain clear audit trail of reward calculations
- Implement reconciliation process with Toluna
- Provide transparent reward history to users
- Create automated alerts for significant discrepancies

#### Quota Fulfillment Tracking
**Issue**: Quotas may fill faster than expected, leading to wasted user attempts.

**Solution**:
- Implement near real-time quota monitoring
- Create a quota priority queue system
- Reserve quotas briefly during user session
- Develop predictive models for quota fill rates

#### Survey Quality Issues
**Issue**: Some surveys may have quality issues leading to poor user experience.

**Solution**:
- Implement survey rating system for users
- Track completion rates by survey
- Create blacklist capability for problematic surveys
- Share quality feedback with Toluna

#### Seasonal Survey Volume Fluctuations
**Issue**: Survey volume may vary significantly by season or time period.

**Solution**:
- Develop alternative engagement strategies for low-volume periods
- Create predictive models for survey volume
- Implement user communication for expected volume changes
- Diversify survey sources if possible

### 5. Technical Implementation Edge Cases

#### Database Scaling
**Issue**: Database performance issues as user base and survey volume grows.

**Solution**:
- Implement efficient indexing strategy
- Design for horizontal scaling
- Separate read/write operations where possible
- Implement data archiving for historical records

#### Mobile Network Reliability
**Issue**: Users on mobile devices may experience connectivity issues during survey participation.

**Solution**:
- Implement offline-capable components where possible
- Create graceful session recovery
- Minimize data transfer requirements
- Provide clear error messages for connectivity issues

#### Browser Compatibility
**Issue**: Survey rendering may vary across browsers and devices.

**Solution**:
- Test across multiple browsers and devices
- Implement browser detection and compatibility warnings
- Create fallback rendering options
- Monitor browser-specific completion rates

#### Performance Optimization
**Issue**: System performance degradation under load.

**Solution**:
- Implement performance monitoring
- Optimize database queries
- Use caching strategically
- Implement background processing for intensive operations
